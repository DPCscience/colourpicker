```
I see

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  RStudio (3:47, 9:46)
  addin (9:54)
  availble (11:5)

and the last of those looks real... Please fix and resubmit.

```
Thanks, can you please write add-in  and single quote software names such as 'RStudio' and 'Rmarkdown'.

Please fix and resubmit.

Best,
Uwe Ligges
```

## Round 2

### Submission comments

Placed single quotes around rmarkdown and rstudio. Lower-cased "Addin" to "addin", but didn't hyphenate it because the official RStudio addins website and the IDE do not hyphenate it.
